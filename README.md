   # Lyrics-Conditioned Neural Melody Generation

If you use our lyrics-melody dataset and lyrics embedding (including our skip-gram mdoel and BERT model repectively trained in our lyrics dataset), please kindly cite our paper
"Conditional LSTM-GAN for Melody Generation from Lyrics" available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.05551.pdf (more details about lyrics-melody dataset and melody generation from lyrics)

You can find our 12 melodies (melodies_experiment.zip) used in subjective evaluation of this paper. 
These 12 melodies respectively are generated by baseline method, LSTM-GAN, and ground truth.

--baseline method: bas1-4--; --LSTM-GAN:gen1-4--; --ground truth:GT1-4--

Answers to your questions:

1. --Which folder/file I can use to crawl/have 12,197 MIDI files (7,998+ 4,199) ? -- lmd-full_and_reddit_MIDI_dataset.

2. --Which folder/file I can use to crawl/have 7,998 MIDI ﬁles come from "LMD-full" MIDI Dataset? -- lmd-full_MIDI_dataset.

3. --Which folder/file I can use to craw/have 4,199 MIDI ﬁles come from reddit MIDI dataset? -- The reddit dataset is not parsed alone. You can find it by using "lmd-full_and_reddit_MIDI_dataset".

4. --Which folder/file I can use to get all syllable-level, word-level, and sentence-level embedding vectors extracted from our trained  Skip-gram model? -- Skip-gram_lyrics_encoders (lyric_encoders) contains all trained models.

5. --Which folder/file I can use to get all syllable-level, word-level, and sentence-level embedding vectors extracted from our trained BURT model? -- This is not uploaded due to limited space, but, you can email us to obtain.

6. --Which folder/file I can use to get information about how to directly use the trained Skip-gram model to extract lyrics embedding vectors? -- Skip-gram_model_script_to_extract_syllables_and_word_level_embeddings.ipynb can be used to directly get embeddings.

7. --Which folder/file I can use to get information about how to directly use the trained BURT model to extract lyrics embedding vectors? -- This is not uploaded due to limited space, but, you can email us to obtain.

8. --Which folder/file we can use to get lyrics embedding vectors used in the paper "Conditional GAN-LSTM for Melody Generation from Lyrics"? -- Same script can be used to get the embeddings (Skip-gram_model_script_to_extract_syllables_and_word_level_embeddings.ipynb  can be used to directly to get embeddings).

More details:

For the project, two differents dataset were used : 
- One dataset that can be found in the "partial_dataset" folder and comes from the LAKH Midi Dataset lmd-full (downloadable at this url : https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/). Only English songs were used from the dataset.
  To download the MIDI files corresponding the .npy files from the dataset, you can search the names of the files in both dataset, that   are unchanged and serve as ID.
  This dataset was used for training the LSTM-GAN model. Both word-level parsing and syllable-level parsing were used in the training (see below for more information)
  
  
- One dataset that is made by mergind the one from LAKH Midi Dataset and one found on https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3akhxy/the_largest_midi_collection_on_the_internet/. 
  This dataset was used for training the Skip-gram embeddings as well as the BURT embeddings. Fom this dataset, only Word-level parsing was used.


lyrics embeddings for "lmd-full + reddit" are used for training skip-gram model and BURT model, while, lyrics embeddings for "lmd-full" are used for training, validation, and testing in Conditional LSTM-GAN model for melody generation from lyrics. 


The parsing is as follow :

— The syllable parsing :
  This format is the lowest level that pair together every notesand the corresponding syllable and it’s attributes.

— The word parsing :
  This format regroups every notes of a word and gives the attributesof every syllables that makes the word.


— The Sentence parsing :
  Similarly, this format put together every notes that forms asyllable (or in most case, a lyric line) and it’s corresponding attributes.


— The Sentence and word parsing :
  Using the two last mentionned format, this one consist ofparsing the lyrics and notes in sentences and, whithin these sentences, to separateeverything in words.1
  
One note always containing one and only one syllable.
We parsed every songs in continous attributes and discrete attributes.

The discrete attributes are, in order:

— The Pitch of the note :
  In music, the pitch is what decide of how the note should beplayed. We used the Midi note number as an unit of pitch, it can take any integervalue between 0 and 127.

— The duration of the note :
  The duration of the note in number of staves. It can be a quarter note, a half note, a whole note or more. The exhaustive set of values itcan take in our parsing is : [0.25 ;0.5 ;1 ;2 ;4 ;8 ;16 ;32].


— The duration of the rest before the note :
  This value can take the same numerical values as the Duration but it can also be null (so zero).


The continuous attributes are, in order:

— The start of the note : In seconds since the beginning of the sung song.

— The length of the note : In seconds.

— The frequency of the note : In Hertz.

— The velocity of the note : Mesured as an integer by the pretty_midi python package.



An example on the song Listen to the Rhythm of the falling rain in the syllable parsing is :
